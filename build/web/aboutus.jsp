  <h3><p class="w3-opacity"><i>'Agrosale' embraces a broad all-inclusive category of products related to AGRICULTURE. 
            It includes a comprehensive range of raw and finished goods under the classifications of plants, animals and other life forms. 
            The term 'agro' has stemmed from the Greek word 'agros' meaning field, which has led to its current usage meaning anything that falls under the 'agricultural' category. 

Agro products are the life force, the very source of survival for the human kind. It is not only that man breathes with the support of food but a major chunk of the world population is also dependent on agriculture as their source of survival. An approximate 36% of the world's workers are engaged in agriculture with India's 65% of the population being directly and indirectly employed in this sector.
